
The folder contains: 7 image files for the total green, blue, grey and total water footprint related to 
	domestic water supply, agricultural and industrial production in mm/yr (Fig 2 and Fig 3 of Report 50)


the image files:
- WF_pdntot_GN - total green water footprint related to production in mm/yr
- WF_pdntot_BL - total blue water footprint related to production in mm/yr
- WF_pdntot_GY - total grey water footprint related to production in mm/yr

- WF_pdn_agr - total water footprint related to agricultural production in mm/yr
- WF_pdn_ind - total water footprint related to industrial production in mm/yr
- WF_pdn_dom - total water footorint related to domestic water supply in mm/yr
- WF_pdn_tot - total water footprint related to production in mm/yr


Figure 2. The green, blue and grey water footprints within nations in the period 1996-2005. 
	The data are shown in mm/yr on a 5 by 5 arc minute grid. Data per grid cell have been calculated as the water footprint 
	within a grid cell (in m3/yr) divided by the area of the grid cell (in 103 m2).

Figure 3. The water footprint within nations in the period 1996-2005, shown by sector: the total water footprint of agricultural production (above), 
	the total water footprint of industrial production (middle) and the total water footprint related to domestic water supply (below). 
	The data are shown in mm/yr on a 5 by 5 arc minute grid. Data per grid cell have been calculated as the water footprint within a grid cell (in m3/yr) divided by the area of the grid cell (in 103 m2).
