        <h3>Drought is caused by climate variations, like changes in rainfall and evaporation rates...</h3>
        <!-- Rain illustration? -->
        <h3>But the drought we worry about is ultimately a human problem – drought can have huge social, economic, and environmental impacts because of how we manage water.</h3>
    </div>
    <div id = "highlight">
    <br>
        <h2>So how can we reduce our water consumption?</h2>
    <br>
            <h4>1) Taking shorter showers?</h4>
            <p>A 10 minute shower with an average U.S. showerhead would use 21 gallons of water.</p>
            <p>If you halved that time, you’d be saving 10.5 gallons of water per day, or 73.5 gallons in a week.</p>
    <br>
            <h4>2) Not watering your lawn? </h4>
            <p>If you ran a sprinkler from an average garden hose for 1 hour, you would use about 1020 gallons of water.</p>
            <p>If you watered your lawn every other day, you’d be saving around 3060 gallons of water in a week.</p>
    <br>
            <h4>3) Going vegan?</h4>
            <p>Around 92% of our daily water use is hidden in the food we consume, especially meats.</p>
    <br>
    </div>
    <!-- this section: visualize somehow? -->
    <p>So if you normally ate a pound of beef per day (between lunch and dinner) and gave it up for a week, you would save <b>12915 gallons</b> of water.</p>
    <p>But between irrigation for crops and drinking water for livestock, the United States uses about <b>117 billion gallons</b> of water per day. </p>
    <p>That would take over 9 million people (about 9,060,000 or 3% of the US) all giving up a week of beef to counteract ONE day of industrial agriculture.</p>
    <p>(Or, you could give up beef for 173,623 years.)</p>
    <br>
    <p>But if you don’t get your protein from meat, you have to replace it with other nutritional foods with their own water footprint…</p>
        <!-- VIS: food water footprint/nutrition -->
        <svg width="700" height="400">
            <rect x="0" y="0" width="700" height="400" fill="grey"/>
        </svg>
    <br>

    <div id = "highlight">
    <br>
        <h2>But are these changes accessible?</h2>
    <br>
        <p>This plan only works if you can afford the time and money to consciously change your diet and prepare meals with different foods.</p>
    <br>
        <h4>Around <b>46,535,888 people</b> in the US participate monthly in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</h4>
        <p>...and around <b>20,400,000 people</b> are living in deep poverty and most likely cannot provide the supplemental income for extra food.</p>
    <br>
        <h4>So even if we could convince a portion of the population to cut certain water consumption-heavy foods out of their diet, it seems like we’re fighting a losing battle.</h4>
    <br>
        <h3><b>Even if we all were conscious of our lifestyle choices and had the ability to change them, this alone would not counteract the impact of drought.</b></h3>
    <br>
    </div>
    <h2>So what else can you do?</h2>
    <p>How can we know where our water is going and effect change?</p>
