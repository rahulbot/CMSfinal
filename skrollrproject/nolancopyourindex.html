        <p>I'll bet you've heard about the droughts in the United States... </p>
            <div><!-- VIS: drought --> </div>
        <p>...and about how you should stop eating meat and showering to reduce your water consumption, right?</p>
        <p>If you're doing that, that's great!</p>
        <p>On average, you would save this much water in a year through not eating (chicken, pork, beef):</p>

        <h2>HOWEVER.</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>It would take this many years to save as much water as industrial agriculture uses in just one year.</p>
        <!-- Maybe see if we can find data for "It would take this many years to offset water to get industrial ag to be sustainable for one year -->

        <h2>Wow, that's demoralizing.</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>And let's face it: not everyone will or can stop eating meat.</p>
        <p>Foods with meat and dairy are often the cheapest and easiest options.</p>

            </svg>
        <p>And many people in this country simply cannot afford the time or cost of preparing fresh, meatless meals.</p>

        <h2>But why is this food so cheap?</h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        <p>One big reason: food subsidies.</p>

        <p>The meat and dairy industries, as well as feed crops, receive the majority of food subsidies in the United States.</p>
        <p>This allows these businesses to sell meat for a much lower cost.</p>

    <br>
    <div>
        <p>This is how much water is lost per year per dollar of subsidies.</p>
